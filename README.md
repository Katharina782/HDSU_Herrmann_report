written for the analysis including results.

The report is interactive. 

The main part consists of four chapters. Navigate between the chapters using 
the drop down menu in the navigation bar. Each chapter is structured like this:

* The main results, interpretations and conclusions are shown automatically
* You can navigate between tabs to compare different figures and tables
* For more details on intermediate analysis steps and supplementary plots you
can click on the small black arrows
* Some supplementary analysis steps can be found in the Appendix of each chapter
* On the top right of each page you can choose whether you want to display 
code chunks or not
  + If you choose not to show code chunks automatically, you can click on the 
  black "Code" tabs to have a look at the code
  

All Rmd files can be downloaded by clickin on the "Code" dropdown menu and 
selecting "Download Rmd" at the top right of each page. If you want to modify 
the files and rerun the analysis, you can get all files, tables and objects
in the data folder () on the Curry Cluster.
