# Microglial cell heterogeneity in HIV

Microglia cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection. In patients
receiving antiretroviral therapy active viral replication is suppressed, but 
latently infected microglia form a virus reservoir in the brain which would 
quickly lead to a rebound as soon as the treatment was stopped. HIV associated
neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is prevalent among HIV infected patients. So far,
little is known about what the role of microglia cells is in HAND. Because it 
is difficult to gain access to microglia cells of the brain, several models have
been used, like immortalized microglia in cell culture or microglia cells derived
form human induced pluripotent stem cells. It has also been proposed that
cells in the cerebrospinal fluid could be microglia-like and, therefore, be used
as a model. Comparing cells form the different models it becomes evident that 
they are very different and not always showing similar gene expression patterns.
Two different approaches have led to
